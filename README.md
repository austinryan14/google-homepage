Making my own Google clone via The Odin Project. Will add what I have learned after I have completed the project.

Followed this video along as a tutorial to get most of the code, and added my own touches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2QTcSOXF0Q

Watching the video helped out a lot as on how to get started. One thing I learned is assign every section, element, and item with its own id or class for easy referencing. Another thing I learned is work in chunks. In the video he separated the site into three sections, Navbar, Body, and Footer, and worked on them separately. I would have just tackled it all at once.

This also got me more familiar with Grid items and tweaking the paratemers and spacings to get things just right, such as the buttons and footer elements.
